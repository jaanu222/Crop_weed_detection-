Crop and Weed Detection 



This is my internship project for UCT under the domain Agriculture



 Problem Statement

Weeds reduce crop yield and waste nutrients. This project uses image-based detection to identify and classify crops vs weeds using YOLO object detection.



 Dataset

1300 labeled images (512x512)

 Includes sesame crops and various weeds

YOLO annotation format

Tech Stack

Python

 OpenCV

 Keras / TensorFlow

YOLOv5

Google Colab

Process

Collected & cleaned data

Resized to 512x512

Data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator

 Manual annotation with bounding boxes

Trained YOLOv5 for classification



Results

- Achieved accurate detection of weeds

- Can be used to build smart pesticide sprayers



 Learnings

Understood how object detection works

 Learned about YOLO and data augmentation

 Got hands-on experience with computer vision
